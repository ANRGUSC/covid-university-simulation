# Simulation-Based Analysis of COVID-19 Spread Through Classroom Transmission on a University Campus

This repository presents the source code for analyzing the airborne COVID-19 transmission risk associated with holding in-person classes on university campuses.

The code requires information regarding the classrooms, such as their location name, area, and air change rate. Furthermore, it needs information regarding the students' schedule for the semester, such as their courses and the location and time of those courses. All of the required datasets can be generated via the synthetic generator provided in the source codes. 

Given this information, the provided code will generate the students' infection probability distribution after operating the university for one week of classes. Various policies such as hybrid scheduling, mask-wearing, and occupancy reduction can be evaluated using this repository to help with making effective decisions for the universities in the case of an epidemic.

<ins>***This model can be replicated by other universities to help mitigate Covid-19 cases***</ins>.
